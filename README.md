# Serial-Peripheral-Interface-VHDL
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data protocol used for communication between digital circuits. Therefore with SPI interface FPGAs or microcontrollers can communicate with peripheral devices, sensors and also other FPGAs and microcontrollers quickly over short distances.
